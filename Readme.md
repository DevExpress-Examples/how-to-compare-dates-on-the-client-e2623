# How to compare dates on the client


<p>This example illustrates how to compare values of two ASPxDateEdits on the client side. The result (number of days between the start date and end date is displayed in the ASPxTextBox).<br />
If the end date is less than the start date, the second editor becomes invalid.</p>
